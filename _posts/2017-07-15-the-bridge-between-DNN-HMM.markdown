# This is a blog explaining the bridge between DNN and HMM in speech recognition

This is my first blog. I have been planning to write blog long before. However it didn't happen until recently. Hopefully I could keep updating this blog regularly.

In this first blog, I will write something about an issue which has been confusing me a lot recently. It is an issue in speech recognition field. The issue is how people apply Deep Neural Network (DNN) on top of HMM to perform speech recognition. 

Some references [^ref1], [^ref2]


[^ref1]: A tutorial on hidden Markov models and selected applications in speech recognition
[^ref2]: An introduction to hybrid HMM/Connectionist continuous speech recognition
[^ref3]: Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition
