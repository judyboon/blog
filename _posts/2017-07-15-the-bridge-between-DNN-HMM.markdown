# This is a blog explaining the bridge between DNN and HMM in speech recognition

This is my first blog. I have been planning to write blog long before. However it didn't happen until recently. Hopefully I could keep updating this blog regularly.

As the first blog, I will write a issue which has been confusing me a lot recently. It is an issue in speech recognition field. The issue is how people apply Deep Neural Network (DNN) on top of HMM to perform speech recognition.
